           <p>Hop King holds a special place as one of my initial C++ projects, where I embarked on recreating one of my earlier games originally made in Unity, this time with my own art! It was built using a lightweight SDL framework provided by HowestDAE.  Go and give it a try!</p>

                <p>One of my favorite assignments during my education at HowestDAE was to develop an AI agent that was capable of navigating and surviving in a 2D world full of zombies and crucial items to survive. 
This project allowed me to dig deeper into techniques that I had only partially grasped during my Unity developer days, such as Behavior Trees, Influence maps, and Steering behaviors.

                <p>Embarking on a research project as part of the Gameplay Programming course at HowestDAE, I sought to unlock the mysteries of player AI engines. While chess engines fascinate me, I decided to take a different approach and explore the implementation of the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm for the game of Connect 4. I investigated strategies for optimizing and improving the model and learned a great deal about the intricacies of adaptive search algorithms and decision-making processes in game-playing AI.
